# Novel Approaches for hh->4b production Using Machine Learning
This a project that aims to develop new ML approaches to distinguishing dihiggs decays to 4 b-jets (hh &rarr; bbbb) from the dominant QCD background at the LHC. We have lots of ideas, and we just gotta figure out if any of them work. 

## File Information
This project uses input files generated from Madgraph interfaced with Pythia8 and Delphes. See the testSamples_10k/ and samples_30k/ subdirectories for Feynman diagrams and cards used to generated the samples used.

## Reconstruction Algorithms
The higgsReconstruction/ directory contains jupyter notebooks and python scripts/classes used to test the efficiency of various algorithms used to reconstruct a dihiggs-like system.
