\section{Semi-Supervised Learning}
\label{sec:semisupervised}
While it makes sense to treat searches for new physics or rare signatures as a supervised classification problem, an alternative approach is to let an algorithm learn intrinsic features from an unlabeled dataset and then evaluate whether this self-learned information can be used to separate signal from background processes. This type of approach is called semi-supervised learning because an algorithm identifies patterns in the data in an un-supervised way and is then evaluated using known classification information.
