\section{Semi-Supervised Learning}
\label{sec:semisupervised}
While it makes sense to treat searches for new physics or rare signatures as a supervised classification problem, an alternative approach is to let an algorithm learn intrinsic features from an unlabeled dataset and then evaluate whether this self-learned information can be used to separate signal from background processes. The process of learning features from unlabelled datasets is called unsupervised learning. Unsupervised machine learning can be transformed into semi-supervised learning when the results of unsupervised learning are evaluated using known classification information.
