\abstract{Machine learning techniques have started being low-key legit in the realm of high energy physics analysis. Powerful methods can be used to identify and measure rare processes from previously insurmountable backgrounds. One of the most profound Standard Model signatures still to be discovered at the LHC is the pair production of Higgs bosons through the Higgs self-coupling. The small cross section of this process makes detection very difficult even for the decay channel with the largest branching fraction ($hh\rightarrow b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$). This paper benchmarks a variety of approaches (boosted decision trees, neural networks with straightforward and novel architectures, semi-supervised algorithms) against one another in an attempt to catalogue the various avaiable to high energy physicists as the era of the HL-LHC approaches.}
