\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Measuring the rate of di-Higgs production will be a problem facing the high energy physics community through the end of the HL-LHC era. The techniques explored in this paper show the power of machine learning techniques in identifying di-Higgs signals amid overwhelming QCD backgrounds. The significance obtained for many of these methods is impressive given the simplicity of the evaluation metric. This bodes well for both current and future measurements of Higgs pair production at the LHC.
