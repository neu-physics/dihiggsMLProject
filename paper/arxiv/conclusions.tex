\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Measuring the rate of dihiggs production will be a problem facing the high energy physics community until the end of the HL-LHC era. The techniques explored in this paper show the power of machine learning techniques to identify dihiggs signals from amongst overwhelming QCD signals. The significance obtained for many of these methods is impressive given the simplicity of the evaluation metric and bodes well for current and future measurements of double higgs prodcution at the LHC.
