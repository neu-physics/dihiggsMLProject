\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
Measuring the rate of di-Higgs production will be a problem facing the high energy physics community through the end of the HL-LHC era. The techniques explored in this paper show the power of machine learning techniques to identify di-Higgs signals from amongst overwhelming QCD signals. The significance obtained for many of these methods is impressive given the simplicity of the evaluation metric. This bodes well for both current and future measurements of double Higgs production at the LHC.
