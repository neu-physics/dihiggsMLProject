% The bibliography will probably be heavily edited during typesetting.
% We'll parse it and, using the arxiv number or the journal data, will
% query inspire, trying to verify the data (this will probalby spot
% eventual typos) and retrive the document DOI and eventual errata.
% We however suggest to always provide author, title and journal data:
% in short all the informations that clearly identify a document.

% Please avoid comments such as "For a review'', "For some examples",
% "and references therein" or move them in the text. In general,

% accessory text in footnotes.
