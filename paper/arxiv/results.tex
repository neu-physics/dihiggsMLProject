yeah, lots of work. need to compare results. 0PU and also 200PU. Talk about why things are different. What makes different approaches useful and when? Also what's up with differences in level of inputs?

Also what about the semi-supervised shit? Worthwhile maybe to show performance with a benchmark BSM model not trained on? Semi-supervised might shine here while fully supervised totally fails
