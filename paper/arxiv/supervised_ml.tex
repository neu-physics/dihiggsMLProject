\section{Supervised Learning}
\label{sec:supervised}
Searches for specific signatures or interactions in collider data can in general be thought of as a classification problem - some known signal process must be identified and separated from some known and well-modeled set of background processes. Any iterative algorithm can then improve its ability to properly identify signal from background by comparing its predictions to the true known classifications and adjusting its internal parameters. This type of approach is known as supervised machine learning, and it is particulary relevant for measuring dihiggs decays.
