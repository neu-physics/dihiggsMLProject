%Dihiggs physics is cool. Also complicated but not that complicated. Mostly just rare. Show some diagrams. Talk about rates.
\section{Dihiggs Physics}
\subsection{Double Higgs Production}
\label{sec:physics}
The Higgs boson is an essential part of the SM and is a product of the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. Along with the interaction of the Higgs with the other particles of the Standard Model, the SM predicts the interaction of the Higgs boson with itself at tree-level (self-interaction). This mechanism contributes to non-resonant Higgs boson pair production together with quark-loop contributions via Yukawa-type interactions. Figure~\ref{fig:nr_hh_production} shows a schematic diagram of non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Since the production cross section for Higgs boson pair production is extremely small within the Standard Model, 
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{hh}\text{ (13 TeV)} = 33 \text{ fb},
\end{equation*}
any significant enhancement would indicate the presence of new physics.

Many extensions of the SM predict the existence of additional scalar bosons which may have mass larger than twice the Higgs mass and can decay into a Higgs boson pair. Searching for resonances in the $hh$ mass spectrum can help us discover or limit exotic models which predict the presence of such particles. More importantly, measuring the SM dihiggs cross-section (or placing limits on its magnitude) allow us to probe the self-coulpling of the Higgs field and better understand the mechanism behind electroweak symmetry breaking.

The following work is focused on techniques for distinguishing non-resonant (SM-like) Higgs boson pair production where both Higgs bosons decay via $h \to b \bar{b}$. The choice of using the $4b$ decay mode provides the largest possible amount of signal events but requires powerful background reduction techniques due to the large production cross-section of fully hadronic QCD processes. All results are quoted for simulated events produced by $pp$ collisions with a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and scaled to the full design luminosity of the HL-LHC (an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb$^{-1}$). Simulated samples are produced with Madgraph~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} and recontructed in Delphes~\cite{de_Favereau_2014} using an approximation of the upgraded Phase-II CMS detector.

\subsection{Event Reconstruction}
We tried a lot of different methods to build dijet pairs for $hh$ reconstruction. This inherently involves making some choices, and no method is 100\% efficient. Sometimes one or another is better for a given method. What's cool is that some methods don't require reconstrucion at all.

The first step in reconstructing the 4$b$ system is to reconstruct and select b-jet candidates. Jets are clustered using an anti-$k_T$ algorithm with a radius of R=0.4. To be selected for use in event reconstruction, a jet must have $\pt > 20$ GeV and an absolute value of $\mid\eta\mid < 2.5$. Delphes uses an internal $b$-tagging efficiency parameterization to predict whether jets are tagged, and an event is reconstructed only if at least 4 jets are $b$-tagged unless otherwise specified. The properties and kinematics of selected jets are shown in Fig~\ref{fig:jetInfo}. This strict requirement of having at least 4 $b$-tags in an event helps to reduce contributions from QCD and reduce the combinatoric ambiguity in event recontruction.

Once events with at least 4 $b$-tags are selected, there is a choice about how to reconstructed the dihiggs system. Several reconstruction methods were testedfor pairing b-jets to find an optimal algorithm for correctly pairing Higgs boson consituents, and two algorithms were selected for use in the following sections. The first iterates through all selected jets in an event and returns the two pairs with closest dijet masses ('equalDijetMass'), and the second returns the two jet pairs that minimize the difference between the candidate pairs and a higgs boson mass of 125 GeV ('closestDijetMassToHiggs'). Fig~\ref{fig:jetInfo} shows a selection of distributions describing the reconstructed dihiggs system for each algorithm. Unless otherwise specified, the 'equalDijetMass' algorithm is used for machine learning techniques that require reconstructed events.
