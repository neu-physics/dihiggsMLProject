%Dihiggs physics is cool. Also complicated but not that complicated. Mostly just rare. Show some diagrams. Talk about rates.
\section{Dihiggs Physics}
\label{sec:physics}
The Higgs boson is an essential part of the SM and is a product of the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking. Along with the interaction of the Higgs with the other particles of the Standard Model, the SM predicts the interaction of the Higgs boson with itself at tree-level (self-interaction). This mechanism contributes to non-resonant Higgs boson pair production together with quark-loop contributions via Yukawa-type interactions. Figure~\ref{fig:nr_hh_production} shows a schematic diagram of non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. Since the production cross section for Higgs boson pair production is extremely small within the Standard Model, 
\begin{equation*}
\sigma_{hh}\text{ (13 TeV)} = 33 \text{ fb},
\end{equation*}
any significant enhancement would indicate the presence of new physics.

Many extensions of the SM predict the existence of additional scalar bosons which may have mass larger than twice the Higgs mass and can decay into a Higgs boson pair. Searching for resonances in the $hh$ mass spectrum can help us discover or limit exotic models which predict the presence of such particles. Figure~\ref{fig:resonant_hh_production} shows a schematic Feynman diagram of the resonant production of Higgs boson pairs with the subsequent decays $h \to WW^{\ast}$ and $h \to b \bar{b}$.

The following chapter discusses the results of a search for both non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production with one Higgs boson decaying via $h \to b \bar{b}$, and the other via $h \to WW^{\ast} \to l\nu q\bar{q}$ (where $l$ is either an electron or a muon). The Higgs boson decay modes chosen for this analysis are a compromise between signal sensitivity and background reduction. The $h \to WW^{\ast}$ branching ratio is the second largest after $h \to b \bar{b}$. In the semileptonic \bbWW final state, the dominant background is \ttbar production. This search uses the full 2015 and 2016 dataset of $pp$ collisions produced at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV (corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$) and recorded using the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. This is the first search for double Higgs production using the semileptonic \bbWW final state.
