# Introduction

# Notebook Information
## FirstNetwork
An adaptation of the neural [network](https://github.com/neu-physics/leptonIdentificationNN/blob/master/network_files/leptonIdNN_Final.ipynb) I wrote for distinguishing between electrons and muons to the dihiggs vs qcd classification problem.

## PytorchNetwork
Basically rewriting the FirstNetwork but with Pytorch tools. Is super inneficcient, but gets ~60% accuracy. 

## PytorchFeedforward
Adapting the network I found [here](https://github.com/yhuag/neural-network-lab/blob/master/Feedforward%20Neural%20Network.ipynb) to the dihiggs vs QCD problem. Harnesses the power of Pytorch way better than PytorchNetwork.
