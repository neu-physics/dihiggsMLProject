Directory with cards used to generate dihiggs -> 4b and QCD -> 4b samples using Madgraph_2.6.4 with Delpes_3.4.1 and the CMS_PhaseII_[0PU,200PU]_v02.tcl cards

Five samples:

1) dihiggs_CMS-PhaseII_0PU, dihiggs sample with 0 pileup
2) dihiggs_CMS-PhaseII_200PU, dihiggs sample with 200 pileup
3) QCD-HT300_CMS-PhaseII_0PU, qcd sample with generator level cut of HT > 300 GeV and 0 pileup
4) QCD-HT300_CMS-PhaseII_200PU, qcd sample with generator level cut of HT > 300 GeV and 200 pileup
